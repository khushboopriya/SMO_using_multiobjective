How to compile and run the program
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

type cc m.c -lm

Note: put all the files in one folder.

About the files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
combined.h : This has all the variables used in the code and also the test function which has to be implemented .
             The test problems that are implemented are taken from " NSABC : Non-dominated sorting based multi-objective artificial bee colony
             algorithm and its application in data clustering" authors are: Avadh Kishor, Pramod Kumar Singh,Jay Prakash.

m.c:         This contains the main function and the main implementation of the code.


main.h :     This contains the constraints that has to be applied on swarm size and everything.

This algo instead of using an external archive uses array to store non-dominated population.

Population array stores 1 in D column for those pop who are nondominated in Global leader Learning phase.
Population array stores 1 in D+1 column for those pop who are nondominated in Local leader Learning  phase.
Population array stores crowding dist in D+3 column after sorting pop on basis of crowding distance.
